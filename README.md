A basic malloc and free implementation using C++, sbrk(), and CMake. My goal in this project was to get a better understanding of memory management, and build an implementation that was on par with or better than malloc.

To build:

Clone the repository
Create a build folder (mkdir build , cd build)

Run cmake ..
Run make

Then run the executable
./mmalloc
